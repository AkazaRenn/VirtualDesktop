# Maximize to New Desktop

Built on top of the Virtual Desktop Showcase project, it now detects window maximization events
and move the windows into a new desktop accordingly.

## Features

### Desktop Reorder

After switching to a desktop that is not the main one, it will be moved right next to that,
so the main desktop will always be only one swipe away, just like on a smart phone.

### On Maximize

Move the window into a new desktop named after its File Description.

### On Restore from maximization, minimization or termination

Close the desktop for this window and jump back to the main one (index 0).

### For Floating Windows

Pin all of them for access across desktops.
